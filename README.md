### What I learned

While working on this project, I practiced:

- Creating semantic and accessible HTML structures (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<table>`).
- Styling tables and removing borders from the last row using CSS.
- Using `flexbox` for centering and responsive alignment.
- Applying CSS variables for consistent color and typography management.
